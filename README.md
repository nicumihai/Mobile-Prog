FitToGo

This application for Android is meant for users who hardly have time to exercise and stay fit or for users that want to follow a routine for themselves to stay energetic at all times. 
Any new user will be able to create an account and login with it. Any progress done by the user will be saved online. Settings and other stuff will be saved offline. 
The user can input his weight, his diet and all other details. He can also set a distance to walk daily, also can pinpoint on the maps the daily strolls he has to take in a daily basis(e.g. the user works at a place very far from his home or goes to university). 
Statistics will be kept daily using charts. Users can also check a list of healthy foods or diets to follow if they want to lose weight or keep in shape. 
The application will notify you whenever you have to exercise, walk or even eat regularly, based on time periods.
